# Travel Information

## LA protests and Entering the USC Campus
While there are still ongoing protests in specific areas of LA, the USC campus has not been affected by the protests and is operating as usual. The USC campus is not open to the general public, so you must download the campus access pass to enter campus ([link](https://roboticsconference.org/images/usc_pass/062025_Viterbi_SAC_RSS_Conference.pdf)). 
Earlier, some downtown LA areas were subject to a curfew. These curfews have now been lifted. You can find the latest official updates [here](https://lacity.gov/highlights/curfew-guidance). 
<!-- At the moment, some downtown LA areas are subject to a curfew: this does not apply to residents in that area (open this [link](https://lacity.gov/highlights/curfew-guidance) for official details). Therefore, if you believe that your hotel is in an area affected by the curfew, we invite you to reach out to your hotel to ask if they suggest carrying specific documents with you during your visit to LA. -->

## Airports

The closest large international airport to the University of Southern California is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Some American cities also have flights to Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR), although the commute is longer.


## Directions to the venue

The RSS2025 conference will take place at the University of Southern California (USC). The main conference sessions will be held at the Bovard Auditorium: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/gmsxcUqwNSfjsuHL8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gmsxcUqwNSfjsuHL8)

While Los Angeles has [a significant railway system](https://www.metro.net/riding/guide/system-maps/), the easiest way to get to the USC campus from any airport is still by using rideshare services. Uber, Lyft and Opoli operate in Los Angeles. In LAX, travelers must first take a free shuttle (green buses labeled LAX-it) to the ridesharing area to use these services.

[Metro line E](https://www.metro.net/riding/schedules-2/?line=804) connects Santa Monica to Downtown LA with three stops around USC. Specifically, "Expo Park / USC" is the closest metro station to the Bovard Auditorium. To use the metro (or any public transportation system in LA), travelers need to use a [TAP card](https://www.taptogo.net/TAPPurchase), which can be purchased at most metro stations via TAP vending machines or through [the official Tap App](https://www.taptogo.net/articles/en_US/Website_content/TAP-App).

For attendees who want to drive, daily and hourly parking options are available in and around the campus: [https://transnet.usc.edu/index.php/daily-and-hourly-parking/](https://transnet.usc.edu/index.php/daily-and-hourly-parking/)

## Accommodation

There is a variety of accommodation choices available around the venue. USC operates a hotel adjacent to the campus, which is a 10 minutes walk from the Bovard Auditorium: [USC Hotel](https://uschotel.usc.edu/). RSS 2025 attendees can use the code "Tommy" to book using the university's special rates.
