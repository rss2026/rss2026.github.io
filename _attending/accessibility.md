+ Most of the backstage area

<u>Breastfeeding</u>: Designated lactation rooms at USC can be found [here](https://employees.usc.edu/benefits-perks/family-resources/breastfeeding/).

<u>Emergency Evacuation</u>: In the event of an emergency:
+ Guests seated in the upper orchestra level ADA seating can exit directly out of the lobby, the same way they came in.
+ Guests seated in the lower orchestra level ADA seating can exit out either side of the auditorium and then out the rear of the building
+ The ADA seating area in the first balcony is reached via elevator or stairs. If the elevator is inoperable, guests would need to be carried down the stairs. However, with 12 wheelchair spaces on the orchestra level, we rarely need to seat ADA guests on the balcony.
 
<u>Restroom Directions and Access</u>: There are three disabled toilets in the Bovard Auditorium. Two are on the south side of the auditorium, and one is on the north side. All three are gender-neutral.
