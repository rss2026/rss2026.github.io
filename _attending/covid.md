All in-person attendees will have to adhere to the policies of the venue. As of March 2023, no restrictions apply but we will be monitoring the situation. Details will be shared with attendees on this page. 

These guidelines will depend on the situation, local and federal guidelines, and venue policies.

Barring significant changes in the outlook of the pandemic, we are hoping for broad, safe, and successful in-person attendance by conference participants.

With the support of all of our community members, we can work to reduce the risk of exposure and infection, but we cannot eliminate it. All conference participants assume the risks associated with participation in the conference.
