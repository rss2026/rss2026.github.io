All accepted RSS papers will be highlighted during the conference via both:

* **A 5-minute spotlight presentation**: Talks are up to 5 minutes in length (i.e., strictly up to 300 seconds) followed by 2 minutes of Q&A per paper.
* **Traditional Paper Posters**: Authors will present posters related to their papers during a 1-hour poster session that will take place on the same day as their talk. Posters should be printed in  A0 size in the portrait format 
(W x H = 841mm x 1189mm or 33.1in x 46.8in). 
There is no specific template for the posters. You should choose the format that best represents your research work. Fasteners will be provided to pin posters to panels

To ensure that the presentations go smoothly and following the RSS tradition, we ask all presenters to submit a video of their presentation in advance. The presenters will be speaking live while the recording of their presentation will be playing in the background as a video. For this reason, the presenters are asked not to record sound as part of the presentations except possibly for videos where the sound is useful to understand the experiment. Please take care to rehearse your talk before setting up the slideshow timing, as you will not be able to change the timing once your presentation is submitted. You can record a movie from a self-advancing slideshow in (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-a-presentation-as-a-video%E2%80%8B-in-powerpoint-ba919059-523d-40a8-b99c-08d18996c09d" target="_blank">PowerPoint</a>) and Keynote (export as QuickTime and convert to MPEG-4 using [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/){:target="_blank"}).  

Presentation videos should be submitted using the following form once the RSS 2023 program becomes available:
