We invite proposals for full and half-day workshops and tutorials to take place in conjunction with the “Robotics: Science and Systems” (RSS) 2025 conference. 
Proposals should be submitted by  **February 16, 2025, 23:59 AOE** as a PDF [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuu8djGKQdE9l7Z17Qg8ncLT0-8qYRYjAO84Q_5vLsyRVC8w/viewform?usp=sharing). The conference, including its workshops and tutorials, is planned as an in-person event.

The RSS workshops and tutorials provide high-quality, topically focused forums for researchers at the forefront of robotics.
They will take place at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} in Los Angeles, California, USA, on **Saturday, June 21 (half-day events)** and **Wednesday, June 25, 2025 (full-day events)**. 

Workshops are intended to supplement the research presented in the main proceedings. Tutorials should support researchers new to the field in quickly gaining the necessary skills and knowledge. We are encouraging events that will promote discussion and interaction among the participants. We will prioritize proposals with high educational value, interest, and relevance. 


Specifically, we welcome:

* Proposals with a diverse set of confirmed speakers as well as with a plan for active participation of the audience (e.g., submissions for posters/presentations, discussion sessions, interactive hands-on tutorials, etc.).

* We encourage organizers to consider, among others, the diversity of presenters in terms of: i) Seniority and academic rank (beyond senior researchers, you could invite senior PhD students and postdocs whose work you appreciate), ii) Gender, iii) Race and ethnicity, iv) Geographic location, v) Professional backgrounds (e.g., industry, government, and academia).

* Innovative event structures that will encourage discussion and interaction among the participants. Previous examples include structured debates or groupings of senior and junior researchers for brainstorming new research directions.

* Proposals that will encourage the participation of communities that have not traditionally participated in RSS but are relevant to robotics science and systems, or the practice and philosophy of the discipline.

* Workshops that will encourage analysis and reflection on topics and issues, which formulate challenging problems and promote discussion, debates, and long-term vision. This includes workshops on ideas that may be important for the field but may be poorly treated by the formal peer-review process.

* This year, we particularly encourage tutorials focusing on new tools and methodologies relevant to the RSS audience or showcasing new libraries, which the community can leverage, as well as workshops that focus on the system aspects of Robotics: Science and Systems. 

Workshop/tutorial proposers should indicate to invited speakers that they should not accept to participate in more than 2 workshops or tutorials. 
Organizers should explicitly remind and verify this recommendation with the invited speakers. 
In addition, we require that at least one of the organizers be present in person at the event.

Workshop/tutorial schedules should adhere to the following timelines to allow for room access and catering:
