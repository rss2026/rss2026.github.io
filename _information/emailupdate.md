<!-- ## LA Wildfires and “Soft” Extension of the RSS 2025 Submission Deadline -->

Dear Robotics Colleagues,

As you know, RSS 2025 will be held in Los Angeles this June. The entire organizing team, including our amazing local organizers at USC, has been devastated by the terrible news of the LA wildfires. Our thoughts are with the people, families, and communities impacted by this disaster.

In light of these events and as a gesture of support for the robotics researchers in the area, we have decided to adjust the RSS 2025 paper submission timeline. Specifically, we will allow authors to edit their initial submissions until the supplementary material deadline on **January 31**.

**We still require researchers to submit their title/abstract by January 17, and to submit a semi-complete paper by the January 24 deadline, but we will allow authors to keep editing the pdf of the paper until January 31.** 
The initial submission should be semi-complete, such that we can start assigning area chairs and reviewers  (and issuing initial desk-rejections), but hopefully this “soft” extension should give the authors extra time to polish their papers. Also note that the title, abstract, authors’ list, and keywords cannot be changed after January 24 (authors can only update the pdf).

The revised timeline is as follows:

<!-- <table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Abstract deadline</td>
            <td>January 17th, 11:59pm <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Initial paper deadline</td>
            <td>January 24th, 11:59PM <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a> (this requires a semi-complete pdf of the paper, final title and abstract)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Final pdf submission deadline</td>
            <td>January 31st, 11:59PM <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Supplementary material submission deadline</td>
            <td>January 31st, 11:59PM <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> -->

- Abstract deadline: January 17th, 11:59pm <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a>
- Initial paper deadline: January 24th, 11:59PM <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a> (this requires a semi-complete pdf of the paper, final title and abstract)
- Final pdf submission deadline: January 31st, 11:59PM <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a>
- Supplementary material submission deadline: January 31st, 11:59PM <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a>

We know that this extension provides just a little help for the folks impacted by the wildfires. Nevertheless, we felt it was important for RSS to stand in solidarity with the LA community that will so generously host us this June. While we recognize that this adjustment adds complexity to the review process, we believe it is the right thing to do.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the RSS 2025 Program Chair at [lcarlone@mit.edu](mailto:lcarlone@mit.edu).

Take care, and best of luck with your RSS submissions!

Warm regards,

**The RSS 2025 Organizing Team**

We understand that this is a small gesture in light of the challenges faced by those directly impacted by the wildfires. Nevertheless, we felt it was important for RSS to stand in solidarity with the LA community that will so generously host us this June. While we recognize that this adjustment adds complexity to the review process, we believe it is the right thing to do.
