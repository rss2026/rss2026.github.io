## Spotlight Talks

Each accepted paper (including both Science/Systems papers and Demo papers) will be allocated a spotlight talk. Spotlight talks are up to 4.5 minutes long (i.e., strictly up to 270 seconds) followed by 1.5 minutes of Q&A per paper. 

To ensure that the presentations go smoothly and following the RSS tradition, we ask all presenters to submit a video of their presentation in advance. The presenters will be speaking live while the presentation recording will be playing in the background as a video. For this reason, the presenters are asked not to record sound as part of the presentations except possibly for videos where the sound is useful to understand the experiment. Please rehearse your talk before setting up the slideshow timing, as you will not be able to change the timing once your presentation is submitted. You should have received instructions on how to upload your video via email.

## Posters

<!-- Each accepted paper (including both Science/Systems papers and Demo papers) will also be allocated a poster presentation. Authors will present the poster related to their paper during a 1.5h poster session that will take place on the same day as their talk. In particular, morning talks will present at the poster session during the lunch break, while afternoon talks will present at the poster session during dinner. Authors are encouraged to set up their poster during the coffee break in the morning and remove it after the end of the day. An overview of the schedule is given here: [Program Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/overview/). -->
Authors of accepted papers (including both Science/Systems papers and Demo papers) will also present a poster related to their paper during a 1.5h poster session that will take place on the same day as their talk. In particular, morning talks will present at the poster session during the lunch break, while afternoon talks will present at the poster session during dinner. In addition to presenting their poster, authors of Demo papers will be contacted by the RSS organizers to discuss the logistics of the corresponding demonstration. All authors are encouraged to set up their poster during the first break of the day of their talk and remove it after the end of the day (in other words: posters can stay up for the entire day, even though the authors only have to staff them for 1.5 hours). An overview of the schedule is given here: [Program Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/overview/).

The poster panels are 3 feet by 7 feet (see picture below). Each panel has a firm surface and is best suited to command adhesive strips for paper media or small picture nails for heavier media. We will provide adhesive strips for attachment. Each panel will accommodate two posters (one on either side). This means that each presenter has access to 3 feet by 7 feet of space to display their poster. The poster can be of any size as long as it fits on the poster panel. Please note that power is not available at the posters, and there are no tables or other furniture nearby on which a laptop or other devices may be placed to aid with the presentation. The conference does not provide printing services for posters; however, there is a [FedEx Office Print & Ship Center on the USC Campus](https://local.fedex.com/en-us/ca/los-angeles/office-5261).
