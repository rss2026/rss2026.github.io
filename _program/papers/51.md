<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied agents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a target distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is measured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are constrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control synthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique widely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We formally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form solution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative inference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were previously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no computational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational gradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the target distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on the other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an optimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on non-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved performance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through comprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing and erasing tasks on a Franka robot.
