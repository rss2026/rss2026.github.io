<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Muddy terrains present significant challenges for terrestrial robots, as subtle changes in composition and water content can lead to large variations in substrate strength and force responses, causing the robot to slip or get stuck. This paper presents a method to estimate mud properties using proprioceptive sensing, enabling a flipper-driven robot to adapt its locomotion through muddy substrates of varying strength. First, we characterize mud reaction forces through actuator current and position signals from a statically mounted robotic flipper. We use the measured force to determine key coefficients that characterize intrinsic mud properties. The proprioceptively estimated coefficients match closely with measurements from a lab-grade load cell, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Next, we extend the method to a locomoting robot to estimate mud properties online as it crawls across different mud mixtures. Experimental data reveal that mud reaction forces depend sensitively on robot motion, requiring joint analysis of robot movement with proprioceptive force to determine mud properties correctly. Lastly, we deploy this method in a flipper-driven robot moving across muddy substrates of varying strengths, and demonstrate that the proposed method allows the robot to use the estimated mud properties to adapt its locomotion strategy and successfully avoid locomotion failures. Our findings highlight the potential of proprioception-based terrain sensing to enhance robot mobility in complex, deformable natural environments, paving the way for more robust field exploration capabilities.
