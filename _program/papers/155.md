<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>In this work, we investigate how spatially-grounded auxiliary representations can provide both broad, high-level grounding, as well as direct, actionable information to help policy learning performance and generalization for dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via supervised learning, then use these representations as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real-world. We propose a novel mixture-of-experts policy architecture that can combine multiple specialized expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve the generalization of the policy. This method achieves an average of 11% higher success rate on average over a language-grounded baseline and a 24% higher success rate over a standard diffusion policy baseline for our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with which the policy follows these representations, leading to an additional performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding robot policies with not only broad, perceptual tasks, but also more granular, actionable representations.
