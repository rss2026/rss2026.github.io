The Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) community recognizes the importance of supporting early-career researchers and students in robotics. Such efforts are essential for fostering innovation, strengthening research capacity, and broadening the impact of robotics on society. To that end, [Pathways@RSS](https://sites.google.com/lehigh.edu/pathways-rss2025/home){:target="_blank"} will be a key part of RSS 2025, focusing on initiatives that help prospective and early-career researchers develop their skills and thrive within the robotics community. These initiatives will include co-located events and dedicated activities throughout the main conference.

A major component of [Pathways@RSS](https://sites.google.com/lehigh.edu/pathways-rss2025/home){:target="_blank"} is the [Pathways Fellowship Program](https://sites.google.com/lehigh.edu/pathways-rss2025/home?authuser=0#h.9k5jcvbajbml){:target="_blank"}, designed to help selected participants attend and succeed at RSS 2025. Fellowships will be awarded to BSc, MSc, and first- or second-year PhD students, with priority given to those who have not previously attended RSS or who are new to the robotics research community.
